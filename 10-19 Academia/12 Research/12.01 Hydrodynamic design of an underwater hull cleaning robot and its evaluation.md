# Hydrodynamic design of an underwater hull cleaning robot and its evaluation
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092678216303533
### Introduction
This article discusses about Hull Cleaning Robots. Types of underwater robots mentioned in article:
- Remotely Operated Vehicles
- Autonomous Underwater Vehicles
- Solar powered Autonomous Underwater Vehicles

Issues faced by the underwater HCRS
- drag reduction
- positioning system design

Main focus of the article is **body drag reduction**. Outcomes from this article:
- Optimal shape of the body
- Analysis of flow field
### Body Design
Things to keep in mind while designing the body:
- Mobility and stability
- Convenience of maintenance
- Performance
- Budget or cost
#### Conditions for stability
- Meta-centre(Distance between COG and buoyancy)
	- Short meta-centre is useful for rolling up to 90deg
	- Long meta-centre is useful for long path navigation
- If the centre of gravity
