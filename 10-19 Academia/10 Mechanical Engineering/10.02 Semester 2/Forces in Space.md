# Vector Basics
 A vector in 3 dimensional space can be represented by $(a,b,c)$ or $a\hat{i}+b\hat{j}+c\hat{k}$. 
 
 Another essential aspect is finding the vector from the given coordinates. For example, consider two coordinates as from $(a_{1},b_{1},c_{1})$ and $(a_{2},b_{2},c_{2})$. To find the vector between the points use the following $$(a_{2}-a_{1},b_{2}-b_{1},c_{2}-c_{1})$$
 
 To project a force towards a plane, consider the product of the force and cosine of angle of the force from the plane. For example, consider a force $\vec{F}$ making angles with $\theta_{1}$, $\theta_{2}$ and $\theta_{3}$ with X axis, Y axis and Z axis respectively. The force vectors projected on the plane will be $F\cos \theta_{1}$, $F\cos \theta_{2}$ and $F\cos \theta_{3}$ in X, Y and Z plane respectively.
 
The resultant of vectors can be found by $$\vec{R}=\sqrt{ R_{x}^2+R_{y}^2+R_{z}^2 }$$ where $R_x$,$R_y$ and $R_z$ are $\sum{F_{x}}$,$\sum{F_{y}}$ and $\sum{F_{z}}$ respectively. The angle made with planes, can be found by $$\cos^{-1}{\left( \frac{R_{\text{direction}}}{R} \right)}$$ this is done by interchanging the equation of $R_{\text{direction}}=R\cos \theta$

The product of magnitude and unit vector gives the force. For example, force acting in direction $\vec{AB}$ of magnitude $M$ is given by $$\vec{F}_{AB}=M\hat{u}$$

The sum of square of cosine angles of vector gives 1. $$cos^2{\theta_{x}}+\cos^2{\theta_{y}}+\cos^2\theta_{z}=1$$
# Condition of Equilibrium
Here the object is in equilibrium if the following conditions are satisfied
- $\sum{F_{x}}=0$
- $\sum{F_{y}}=0$
- $\sum{F_{z}}=0$
- $\sum{M}=0$
# Centre of gravity
Theoretical point within an object where its entire weight is considered to be concentrated.
# Centroid
The geometrical central point of plane area or the average position of all points in 2 or 3 dimension shape.
The centroid of a figure with respect to reference points can be found out by the following equations
- $$\bar{x}=\frac{\sum{ax}}{A}$$
- $$\bar{y}=\frac{\sum{ay}}{A}$$
Here 
- $a$ denotes the area of smaller section
- $x$ and $y$ refers to the distance of smaller area from reference point
- $A$ denotes the total area
A better way to represent this would be
- $\bar{x}=\frac{a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\dots+a_{n}x_{n}}{a_{1}+a_{2}+\dots+a_{n}}$
- $\bar{y}=\frac{a_{1}y_{1}+a_{2}y_{2}+\dots+a_{n}y_{n}}{a_{1}+a_{2}+\dots+a_{n}}$
