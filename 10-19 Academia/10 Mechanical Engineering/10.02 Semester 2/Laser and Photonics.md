# Introduction
Laser stands for **L**ight **A**mplification by **S**timulated **E**mission of **R**adiation and can be emitted as light, ultraviolet or X-ray wavelengths.
## Properties of Laser
- **Directionality**
	- Highly directional compared to conventional sources of light
	- Accurate range finder
- **Monochromaticity**
	- Highly monochromatic radiation has small frequency range
	- In laser beam, frequencies of radiations are highly centred about particular frequency
	- Radiation of narrow frequency band is amplified and produced in laser
- **Coherence**
	- Radiations emitted by emitters are in phase and move in same direction
	- Laser beam is spatially, temporally and directionally coherent
	- Conventional sources' coherence length is few centimetres while lasers' can span upto few kilometers
- **Brightness or Intensity**
	- Defined as power emitted  per unit surface area
	- Moderate power laser's brightness magnitude is higher than brightest conventional sources (several orders)
	- Highly directional property

## Absorption
>[!quote] Definition
>The phenomenon of reception of radiation of atoms or molecules for excitation
>OR
>Process of transition of atoms from lower energy level to higher level energy level

Process
- Assume an atom at ground state (level 1), where it stays unless some external energy is applied
- Electromagnetic wave of energy of $h\nu$ is applied
- Atom moves from level 1 to level 2

Dependencies
- energy density of incident radiation at frequency
- number of atoms per unit volume in lower level
## Emission Types
### Spontaneous Emission
>[!quote] Definition
>The phenomenon of emission of radiation by the natural de-excitation of atoms or molecules is called spontaneous emission

Found in conventional sources of light

Process
- Consider an atom at energy level 2.
- The atom **randomly** decays to ground state (level 1)
- Difference in energy is emitted as photon

Frequency due to transition, $$\nu=\frac{E_{2}-E_{1}}{h}$$
Here 
- $h$ is planck's constant
- $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are energy at levels 1 and 2 respectively

Note that, the decay may also occur in non radiative way and the difference energy is transferred as KE to surrounding molecules

Rate of spontaneous emission = $A_{21}N_{2}$

Here
- $A_{21}$ is constant of proportionality (Einstein Coefficient)
- $N_2$ is number of atoms per unit volume

Properties
- Spontaneous
- No phase relationship
- Random direction
- Lack of coherence
### Stimulated Emission
>[!quote] Definition
>The phenomenon of emission of radiation by excited atoms or molecules i the presence of suitable radiation is called stimulated emission

Process
- Excited atom is present in level 2
- Electromagnetic radiation or photon of frequency $\nu=\frac{E_{2}-E_{1}}{h}$ is incident on material
- Excited atoms is forced to give out its energy and decays to ground state
- Energy difference $E_{2}-E_{1}$ is added to incoming radiation
- This results in emission of two identical photons which have same phase, direction and energy

Rate of stimulated emission = $B_{21}N_{2}u(\nu)$

Properties
- Definite phase relationship and coherent
- Directionality
- Proportional to energy density of incident radiation
- Polarisation state of emitted photon = incident radiation
