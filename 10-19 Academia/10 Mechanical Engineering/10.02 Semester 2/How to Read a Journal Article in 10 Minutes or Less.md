# How to Read a Journal Article in 10 Minutes or Less
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=466X7ti1kcs
## Why are journal articles hard to read?
Journal articles are not meant to be read word for word. Rather they are reports. As a student researcher, its important to find and read the parts relevant to the student.
Reading journal articles need training.
Structure of journal articles
- Title
- Abstract
- Introduction
- Methods
- Results
- Conclusion
## Deeper dive into the structure
### Title
The **title** is long enough to convey
- What's being done
- Why its being done
- How's it being done
- To whom its being done
Or in other words title is the one sentence summary of the article
### Abstract
The **abstract** is miniature version of the article
- Background
- Methods
- Results
- Conclusions
### Introduction
The **introduction** is broken down into 
- What is known (literature review)
- What isn't known (research gap)
- What is the hypothesis (research question)
### Methods
The **methods** section is 
- Longest section.
- This is intended for peer reviewers rather than student researchers. Therefore this section can be skipped by student researchers.
### Results
The **results** section consists of 
- raw data without interpretation
- charts and tables
- This part can be usually skipped by student researchers
### Conclusion
The **conclusion** section
- Rather important section
- Summary of findings
- Implications of findings
- This section is to be read word for word and notes should be taken
## Strategy suggested
Strategy suggested for efficient reading:
1. Understand the title because it leads to the essence of the article
2. Read the abstract to determine the relevance, uses or information present
3. If article is relevant skip to findings or conclusions.
